Hello!  This is just a random collection of scripts I have for my various hobbies.

card_games - inventory suggestions for TCGs, sometimes using decks as a basis  
minis_games - inventory suggestions for miniatures games  
utils - a few functions I call a lot  
win_loss - some win-loss data on various games
